                    Vel is not for everyone. <br>
                    Vel is not a brand, is something different. Because you are something different. Vel exists for that people who are “the round pegs in the square holes”  and for “the ones who see things differently”. <br>
                    Vel is something different because is the possibility to express yourself, and the choice to make it.<br>
                    And this is what the symbol ∨ means. <br>
                    <br>
                    Vel makes it different, but there are some things that are important for everyone. <br>
                    <br>
                    Privacy <br>
