                    Vel is not for everyone.<br> 
                    Vel is not a brand, is something different. Because you are something different. <br>
                    Vel exists for that people who are “the round pegs in the square holes”  and for “the ones who see things differently”.<br> 
                    Vel is something different because is the possibility to express, and the choice to make it.<br>
                    And this is what the symbol ∨ means. <br>
                    Vel makes it different, but there are some things that are important for everyone. <br> 
                    Vel is possibility <br>
                    Privacy is important, so <br>
                    Vel gives you the possibility to do not share your personal information. <br>
